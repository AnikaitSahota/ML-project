Expressing sentiments on social media has become an important way for people to express their opinions. With the increase in use of social media, people are able to access information much more easily. But with information, also comes opinions of other individuals, including the positive and negative perspective on various topics. With the differences in opinions and biases in viewpoints, these discussions can easily grow into bullying, hate comments, and harassment. It is important to maintain a positive environment so that its safe for everyone to communicate, discuss, debate and give opinions on social media, without being worried any backlash they might get. Social media is the ideal medium to observe and study the expression of emotions, and in turn, study the sentimental values each expression holds.

# Credits to dataset
The dataset titled "Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets" on Kaggle has about 1.6 million tweets which have been extracted using the twitter API. The tweets have been annotated with a positive and negative label that can be used to detect sentiment. You can find dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). Achnoledgement to stanford to conduct such research ([reserch paper](https://www-cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/papers/TwitterDistantSupervision09.pdf)) and making dataset public.

# Table of contents

After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README.
